sublime-2-configs
=================

Some snippets and macros I use for sublime text 2

If you wish to use these, place them inside the custom packages folder; on Ubuntu, the location is:

`~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User`

Note that there's a submodule in this repository. For very basic submodule usage example, see http://queirozf.com/reminders/git-submodule-basic-usage-examples
